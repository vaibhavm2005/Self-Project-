Project Title: Excel-Integrated Data Management System using VB.NET

Description: This project is a Windows application developed in Microsoft Visual Studio using VB.NET, featuring a secure login system and an Excel-integrated data management interface.

1. Login System: The first window ensures secure access by requiring a valid username and password. Upon successful authentication, a confirmation message ("Login Successful") is displayed, and the main interface opens.


2. Excel Integration: The second window provides a user-friendly interface linked to an Excel file, allowing users to add, edit, and save data dynamically. Any modifications made within the application are automatically updated in the linked Excel file, ensuring real-time synchronization.



This project demonstrates proficiency in VB.NET, XAML-based UI design, Excel file handling, and user authentication mechanisms, making it a useful tool for managing structured data efficiently.
